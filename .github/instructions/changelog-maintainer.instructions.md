# Changelog Maintainer

. **Maintain Context with Changelog:**
   - At the beginning of a new project, create a `CHANGELOG.md` file.
   - This file will serve as the single source of truth for all project history and current state.

2. **Update After Every Change:**
   - After completing a task, making a code change, or concluding a significant conversation, **always** update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
   - The update should be a concise summary of the work done.
   - Example Prompt: "Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the implementation of the user login and registration."

3. **Read for Context:**
   - Before starting any new task, feature, or conversation, **always** read the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
   - This ensures you have complete context of the project's current state and history.
   - Example Prompt: "Read the `CHANGELOG.md` to get up to speed before we begin building the user profile page."

4. **Structure the Changelog:**
   - Format the `CHANGELOG.md` with clear headings for major features and bullet points for individual changes.
   - This makes the file readable and easy to parse for both you and the human user.
   - Example Format:
     ```
     ### [Feature Name]
     - [Description of change 1]
     - [Description of change 2]
     ```
